# Hikoi Crowd Size Estimation

A quick calculation of the size of the crowd for the 2024 hīkoi: Toitū Te Tiriti.

The path is recorded as a kml file, which is loaded in the notebook and used to estimate the area. The crowd density is guessed, mostly from reference images here: https://www.gkstill.com/Support/crowd-density/CrowdDensity-1.html
